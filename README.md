## With this, I bid a heartfelt farewell to this side project of mine. It has been an incredible journey, filled with moments of creativity and growth. Iâ€™ve truly enjoyed building and nurturing it, but the time has come to move on. This will be the final update as I now shift my focus to Project Matrixx, where I aim to pour my energy into reviving and redefining its vision. Thank you all for being a part of this journeyâ€”itâ€™s been an absolute pleasure. Hereâ€™s to new beginnings! ðŸŒŸ
